# MergeReceiptForTaxes
When filing tax returns, I sometimes have to attach a copy of the receipts. Since I take a photo and archive them, the easiest thing is to merge them onto an A4 sheet, trying to optimize the space. This way, I keep the copies and it's easier to give everything to accountants or CAAF.

## Warning: this is a work in progress.
At the moment, files whose name contains "fattura" are considered to be in A4 format.
The others are resized to a width of 76mm.
This is because I do the receipt acquisitions with a photo (Microsoft Lens or Google Drive) and therefore the dimensions of the receipts may vary but are not the correct ones.
