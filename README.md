# MergeReceiptForTaxes
When filing tax returns, I sometimes have to attach a copy of the receipts. Since I take a photo and archive them, the easiest thing is to merge them onto an A4 sheet, trying to optimize the space. This way, I keep the copies and it's easier to give everything to accountants or CAAF.
